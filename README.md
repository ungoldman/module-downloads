## About

## Developing

npm start
npm test
```

1. `git clone` will clone the source of this repository to the working directory in your terminal
1. `npm install` will install all dependencies needed for working on the site
1. `npm start` will build the site and start a local live-reloading server so you can work on the site right away
1. `npm test` will run [`standard`](standardjs.com) to check for syntax errors and enforce code style.
